# Rythm Trainer

The idea for this project is from a saxophone workshop organized by the Aargauische Musikverband, Switzerland. 
I had the impression that this is a well known exercise.
I think it is useful for many instruments or singers. 

After choosing the tempo and metrum (right now either 3 or 4 notes per bar)
two sets of notes are displayed, where in the second set, one is grayed. 
The player plays all the notes, except for the gray one. 
Whether one uses just one tone, or plays a scale, chord, etc. is  up to the player. 
Which note is grayed out is chosen randomly.

Only the single index.html file is needed, it can be copied and used offline.
